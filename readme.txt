SIDO is the new mobile payment platform designed for your online e-commerce store and/or smartphone

== Description ==

BNCâ€™s focus is a new platform which provides the most secure and rewarding way for consumers and merchants to interact. It includes a new way of managing ownership of personal data and payment information, in a world where fraud and identity theft are a threatening reality. We call this platform SIDO.

SIDO stands for Secure ID Online.

SIDO is an exciting new platform integrating the online experiences of shopping, marketing and ecommerce with industry changing security features. SIDO empowers users with ownership of their Online Identity and payment information.

These security benefits apply across the online purchase cycle significantly reducing risk (and cost) of fraud for users, merchants, card providers and banks.

For users, it enables and rewards the sharing of that experience with friends and acquaintances. Merchants will enjoy a broad marketplace within which they can reach consumers with targeted but non-invasive promotions. All in the most secure environment available.
